# My Diary 
MyDiary is an online journal where users can pen down their thoughts and feelings.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
You need to install the following: 
* Server side Framework: â€‹[Flask Python Framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* Testing Framework: [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

### Installing 
These are the series of commands you need to get it up and running on your machine 
#### Clone the repo into your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/kimbugp/Mydiary
```
#### Install virtual environment 
``` 
C:\Users\User>virtualenv venv
```
#### Activate virtual environment
``` 
C:\Users\User>venv\Scripts\activate
``` 

```
(venv) C:\Users\User>
 ```

### Move to the directory of the cloned repository folder
  ```
   (venv)cd /MyDiary
  ```
#### Install modules required for the app 
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Create database by running the following command
```
psql -c 'create database diarydb;' -U postgres
```
### Run create and add test data to the db by
```
flask migrate && flask seed 
```

### Set Up Development With Docker (Preferred setup)

1. Download Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/)
2. Set up an account to download Docker
3. Install Docker after download
4. Go to your terminal run the command `docker login`
5. Input your Docker email and password

To setup for development with Docker after cloning the repository please do/run the following commands in the order stated below:

-   `cd <project dir>` to check into the dir
-   `docker-compose build` to build the application images
-   `docker-compose up -d` to start the api after the previous command is successful

The `docker-compose build` command builds the docker image where the api and its postgres database would be situated.

The `docker-compose up -d` command starts the application 

To stop the running containers run the command `docker-compose down`

### Running Tests
* Install nosetests and coverage
  ```
  $ pytest
  ```
